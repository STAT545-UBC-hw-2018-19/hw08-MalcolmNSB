# hw08-seed

This repo contains a modified BC Liquor app based on the one from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

My modified app can be accessed at [https://malcolm-bowles.shinyapps.io/my_app/](https://malcolm-bowles.shinyapps.io/my_app/).

I implemented the following modifications:


Modifications:                    

- Added `radioButtons` to sort by Name, Price, Alcohol content, or Sweetness            
- Added an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.          
- Fixed issue when the user selects filters that return 0 results.     
- Showed the number of results found whenever the filters change.
